# Engineers Gate Take-Home Test

Welcome to the Engineers Gate Frontend Development Challenge!

## About Engineers Gate

Engineers Gate is a cutting-edge quantitative hedge fund where technology drives alpha generation. We operate in a fast-paced, high-performance environment. Our engineering teams work with large datasets, real-time market feeds, and complex trading algorithms to deliver exceptional results in the financial markets. Our goal is to test your skills, give you an opportunity to show off your talents, and ultimately make a hiring decision based on your work!

## Getting Started

This project requires Node.js version 18.

```bash
# Set Node version
nvm use 18

# Install dependencies and start development server
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## Overview

You will build **3 specific pages** for a trading dashboard:

1. **Home Page** - Display a trades table with the title "Trade Table"
2. **Table Overview Page** - Display 4 separate tables: Credit, Holdings, Risk, and Transactions
3. **Candlestick Charts Page** - Display 3 stock charts: AAPL, MSFT, and TSLA

You'll also enhance the navigation with a logo, tabs, breadcrumb, and light/dark mode toggle.

All data is provided as JSON files - just load and display them. No backend or API needed.
Sample table and candle stick components are provided as well. You will need to update these to support different datasets and make them reusable.

## Evaluation Criteria

You will be graded primarily on **design and organization**. We're looking to assess how you structure components, organize layouts, and create intuitive user experiences.
We are NOT focused on how the data is organized, stored, cached or loaded apart from basic functionality.
We are NOT focused on page routing. Basic page routing is provided.
We ARE evaluating your implementation of light and dark mode.
We ARE evaluating your ability to layout a page in an organized way.
We ARE evaluating your ability to create reusable components and expand upon a pre-existing code base.

Feel free to update and change ANY component. AI, UI libraries and any other external tools are fair game. Use any tool necessary to complete this assignment. All work must be your own.
This assessment has some ambiguity. That is by design. If there is something that is NOT clear to you, do your best to come up with a solution.
It's ok to make some assumptions and to make this project your own.

## Submission Instructions
